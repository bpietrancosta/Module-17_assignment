## Purpose of analysis: To determine if the vine program introduces bias into the review of pet products.

### Overview of analysis: 
By filtering our data according to reviews that were included as part of the vine program and those that weren't we can compare some key metrics to determine whether belonging to the vine program results in review bias. The aforementioned metrics are: total reviews, all 5 star reviews and the percentage of 5 star reviews. 

### Analysis process:
In order to get the data sets that we wanted from the original data set we had to perform certain operations. We removed all instances where a product review had less than 20 and then we made sure that 50% or more of the votes were actually helpful.

### Analysis resulsts:
We have ~ 38% (65 5 stars/170 total) of our reviews that are 5 stars for the vine program and ~ 54% (20612 5 stars/37840 total) of our reviews that are 5 stars for those outside the program. One might think that if you're compensated for providing reviews you may be more favorable towards the product, therefore these results appear counterintuitive. An additional metric that could be used as an explanation for this would be a score of people's engagement. 
One could make the case that if you're seriously being tasked with reviewing a product you may be hesitant to give it a perfect score. Whereas people who review products more flippantly may be more likely to provide perfect scores for reviews.


## Conclusion:
Don't always think that compensation leads to favoritism. Dig deeper.
